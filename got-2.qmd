# Analysis {#sec-analysis}

See @tbl-top-characters for top 10 characters with the most screen time

## Screen time per Character

```{r}

pacman::p_load("readr","ggplot2","dplyr","ggrepel","knitr")

screentimes <- read_delim("GOT_screentimes_1.csv")

screentimes |> str()
screentimes |> summary()

```

```{r}
screentimes_high <- screentimes |> top_n(10, screentime)

screentimes |> 
  ggplot(aes(screentime, episodes)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = screentimes_high,aes(label = name),min.segment.length = 0)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-top-characters
#| tbl-cap: "Top 10 Characters with the most Screentime"

screentimes_high |> 
  select(name,screentime,episodes) |>
